Aviary-Example-For-Web
======================
Web SDK
The Aviary Javascript SDK works in all major browsers, giving you intuitive editing tools for everything from quick fixes and one-tap auto enhance to stylistic effects, cropping, and red eye removal. Adjust the colors of our editor & choose the toolset you need

So, I made a small example for using aviary's web SDK, 
it contains  the following:

1- upload file ( for the user to upload the image)
2- preview Image , to display the uploaded image.
3- an edit button, to call the aviary's javascript code, and let the user do some image effects.
